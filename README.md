Design an Entity Relationship (ER) model for a University database. Letâ€™s assume that we have the following conditions:

<ol>

 <li>A college contains many departments</li>

 <li>Each department can offer any number of courses</li>

 <li>Many instructors can work in a department</li>

 <li>An instructor can work only in one department</li>

 <li>For each department there is a Head</li>

 <li>An instructor can be head of only one department</li>

 <li>Each instructor can take any number of courses</li>

 <li>A course can be taken by only one instructor</li>

 <li>A student can enroll for any number of courses</li>

</ol>

10.Each course can have any number of students

<strong>Use the following steps: </strong>

<strong>Step 1 : Identify the Entities </strong>

<strong>Step 2 : Identify the relationships Step 3: Identify the key attributes</strong>

<strong>Step 4: Identify other relevant attributes (whenever possible) </strong>

By connecting all these details, draw the ER diagram. Submit ER Diagram
